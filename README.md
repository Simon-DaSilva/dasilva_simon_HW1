# SNA: Simon, Nikole, and Anthony

We are Simon, Nikole, and Anthony, mostly known for our amazing talents as marshmallow tower builders ðŸ˜Ž.

## Anthony

Hi, my name is Anthony and a quick fun fact about me is that my favourite animal is the cat (as evident by my GitHub username.) I like coding, music, and getting along with people.

**Hobbies:**

Some of my favourite hobbies are listening to music, coding, and watching Youtube videos about game design. Here is a [video I watched recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaOfb8FRfmE).

**Favourite Mario Characters**

I think your favourite Mario characters say a lot about you, so here are my top 5:

1. Mario

I love Mario as much as the next person, but not enough to put him higher on the list. Sorry Mario...

2. Bowser

The Koopa King is very cool. The one thing I don't like about him is that he dominates me at Mario Kart.

3. Luigi

I used to feel bad for him because he used to live in Mario's shadow, but nowadays he gets the recognition he deserves.

4. Toad

A lot of people find him annoying, but I find his demeanor funny and charming.

5. Bowser Jr.

Bowser Junior! Is he Bowser's biological son? Is he just a koopa Bowser adopted off the street? Who knows?! All that matters is that he's mischievous and funny, and he loves his dad a lot which I can only respect.

Finally, here is a photo of a funny-looking kitten which I cherish.

## Nikole (SooA Cho)

Hello, my name is Nikole. I adore drinking coffee and anything coffee related. I love stuffed animals a lot, and have a collection back home in Korea.

**Hobbies**

I'd say some of my favorite hobbies are playing video games, drawing, making music and streaming. I do at least one of them every single day.

**Other facts about me**

I do multiple things online as part time jobs. I do art commissions, fps video game tourneys, design commissions, manager for content creators, streaming, etc. At first, I started doing all of this for fun, but now I make enough to pay my rent and other living expenses.

Here's a character I really like, because I thought their design looked very cool!

## Simon

Hello, my name is Simon. I am 20 and this is not my first post secondary school. I spent 2 years at western doing computer science but decided it was not for me. I love all animals (insects dont count), but I love cats the most, although im alergic so I can't have one. 

**Hobbies**

I enjoy playing fighting games (my favourite right now is Mortal Kombat 1), reading and listening to music. I mostly read either Novels or manga. I used to watch anime but i'm really not a fan of it anymore. Tiktok will probably be the death of me but I enjoy scrolling through it for hours. I also spent several summers at an overnight camp which I absolutely loved, called Cedar Ridge.

**Accomplishments**

At the previously mentioned summer camp, in my final year I won an award called "the Arrowhead award" for strong leadership and positive attitude. Throughtout middle school and high school I achieved Honor role every year. I also have my bronze cross and first aid tranining. 

This summer I went to Cuba and swam with dolphins, so here is a photo from that.
